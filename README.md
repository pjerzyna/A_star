# A* Path Planning in 2D Occupancy Grid â€“ MATLAB

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements the **A\*** (A-star) pathfinding algorithm on a 2D **occupancy grid** to plan a collision-free path for a mobile robot from a given start to a goal location. The environment includes polygonal obstacles loaded from `.mat` files. The implementation is written in **MATLAB** and was developed for an academic robotics course.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Grid generation from polygon-based obstacles
- A\* algorithm with:
  - Optional diagonal movement
  - Multiple heuristic types: Manhattan, Chebyshev, Euclidean
- Efficient parent-matrix based backtracking
- Clear visualization of occupancy grid and final path

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
A_STAR/ 

â”œâ”€â”€ obstacle1.mat

â”œâ”€â”€ obstacle2.mat

â”œâ”€â”€ obstacle3.mat

â”œâ”€â”€ main.m # main execution file

â””â”€â”€ README.md

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the project in **MATLAB**.
2. Make sure the files `obstacle1.mat`, `obstacle2.mat`, and `obstacle3.mat` are in the same folder as `main.m`.
3. Adjust start and goal positions in `main.m` as needed:

   ```matlab
   startNode = [5.2, 15.5];
   goalNode  = [22.7, 13.1];
4. Run the script:
   main

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visual Output

A typical output plot shows the path traversing from start to goal while avoiding obstacles, with the occupancy grid displayed in grayscale.

## ðŸ§­ Possible Extensions

* Dynamic obstacle handling
* GUI-based interactive start/goal selection
* Integration with real robot path execution
* Export of path to ROS-compatible formats
